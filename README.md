# Colab-Python-Project
Project developed for C-Women Python class
The main objective of this project is to briefly show how Python is used in real life situations, and how to manipulate Excel spreadsheets using different libraries;

Python can save time when working with data analysis. Four files from different cities will be analysed in a big group to find the total amount of products sold in Canada;

New Python codes will be introduced and a real situation with deprecated (discontinued) code will be demonstrated;

The graph shown at the end of the project will be displayed in two different ways, using new codes and codes learned in class.
